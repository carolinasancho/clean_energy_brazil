## Project Description

The main objective of this project was training our skills on asking business questions and take insights through data. I chose Energy as my topic and did a complete analysis, including EDA (numpy, pandas, regex), data viz (matplotlib, seaborn and tableau) and predictions (with skicit learn and Tableau).
I used the data from ONS (National Electricity System Operator) and BP Energy.

## ðŸ›  Tools

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Skicit Learn, Regex, Tableau

## ðŸ›  Data Source:

http://www.ons.org.br/

https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html

##  ðŸ’» Aggregation and Scrapping:

The information was collected in all de data sources previously informed, all the aggregation and analysis were made with pandas and Tableau.
I related all the information by data in order to obtain the answer I was looking for: How will be the brazilian energy sources in 2031? Most of them will be renewable?

##  ðŸ’» Analysis:

The dashboards were developed in Tableau:

##  ðŸ’» Conclusion:
Brazil'll is likely to drop the hydroeletric energy from 64% (nowadays) to 50% or less in 2031. Wind and Solar energy will share together more than 30% off the brazilian eletricity generation.
